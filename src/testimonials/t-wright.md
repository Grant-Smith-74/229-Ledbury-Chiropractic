quote: "Heidi takes the time to research the causes and contributing factors that have led to discomfort enabling an accurate and meaningful diagnosis. Bespoke treatments are then applied to target specific areas of acute discomfort whilst building a longer term strategy to combat chronic aspects of patient discomfort. The approach employed by Heidi has resulted in a tangible and progressive improvement in my well-being."
