**Heidi Tulloch (Doctor of Chiropractic)**

Our senior chiropractic consultant, Heidi, is licensed by the <a href="https://www.gcc-uk.org/" target="blank" title="General Chiropractic Council" rel="noopener">General Chiropractic Council</a> and a member of the <a href="https://chiropractic-uk.co.uk/" target="blank" title="British Chiropractic Association" rel="noopener">British Chiropractic Association.</a>

Heidi trained as a chiropractor at the Welsh Institute of Chiropractic at the University of Glamorgan near Cardiff. Since graduating with a Master of Chiropractic degree, Heidi continues to further her training by attending chiropractic conferences as well as studying areas of particular interest regarding holistic health.

Heidi believes in treating every patient as the individual that they are.  Heidi puts personalised treatment plans in place according to each patient’s needs. Her philosophy is to help patients help themselves to create balance between the mind, body and spirit and so it is important to establish the causes of the health issue in order for the patient to make the adjustments needed to promote healing; all this is done with Heidi’s full support and encouragement. Treatment consists of both active and passive parts in order to resolve the health issue.

Heidi has a warm, friendly and holistic approach designed to put patients at their ease. She takes time with every patient and likes to build strong ongoing relationships so  they can view their chiropractic treatment as part of a bigger health picture.

Prior to chiropractic, Heidi worked in retail management and recruitment consultancy in addition to being a member of the Territorial Army. As well as being a keen horse rider, Heidi enjoys walking her dog Jed, running, cycling and swimming, as well as travelling (she previously spent 12 months travelling Australia as well as other visits to New Zealand, Malaysia and Thailand).
