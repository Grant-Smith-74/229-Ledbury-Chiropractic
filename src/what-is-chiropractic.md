Bespoke treatments are then applied to target specific areas of acute discomfort whilst building a longer term strategy to combat chronic aspects of patient discomfort.

Chiropractic is a primary healthcare profession that specialises in the diagnosis, treatment and management of musculoskeletal conditions that are due to mechanical dysfunction of the joints and muscles, particularly of the neck and back.

The profession is statutorily regulated through the General Chiropractic Council (GCC). It is illegal to practice as a chiropractor without being registered with the GCC.

The British Chiropractic Association (BCA) is the largest and longest standing association for chiropractors in the UK, requiring international standards of education, exemplary conduct and a commitment to on-going professional development.
