citation_01: 'Heidi has been brilliant and helped me no end. The pain I experience is miles better and I now have ways of managing a lot of it myself. A lovely, warm and welcoming atmosphere and a proper friendly face! Heidi gets to know the real ''you'' as well as understanding your problem. I was scared at the thought of ever coming to a chiropractor – don''t knock it ''til you try it.
Above and beyone on COVID safety too – extra gold star!'

Firstly, we hope you and your families are all safe and well during these unprecedented times each and every one of us finds ourselves in.

Secondly, we would like to reassure you that Ledbury Chiropractic Clinic will remain open throughout the COVID-19 government lock-down, so please do get in touch regarding any health issues. Unfortunately, it may be difficult to visit your GP practice so perhaps we can help at Ledbury Chiropractic Clinic.

With very best wishes, Ledbury Chiropractic Clinic.
