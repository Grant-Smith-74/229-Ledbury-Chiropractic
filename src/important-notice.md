Firstly, we hope you and your families are all safe and well during these unprecedented times each and every one of us finds ourselves in.

Secondly, we would like to reassure you that Ledbury Chiropractic Clinic will remain open throughout the COVID-19 government lock-down, so please do get in touch regarding any health issues. Unfortunately, it may be difficult to visit your GP practice so perhaps we can help at Ledbury Chiropractic Clinic.

With very best wishes, Ledbury Chiropractic Clinic.
